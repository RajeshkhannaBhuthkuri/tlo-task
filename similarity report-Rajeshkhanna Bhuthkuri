The following are observed from code1.js and code2.js files:
The entire code in code2.js is same as that of code1.js except few changes that are done just for a change. 
The following changes are observed from code1.js to code2.js except these the remaining code is same between code2.js and code1.js. 
I have saved the code in two different text files and uploaded into Diffchecker where I found that in code2.js there are total number of 279 lines 
whereas in code1.js the number of lines is 269 only. 
Finally, I can conclude that only 10 lines of the program code is changed at few places and the remaining code is as it is between code1.js and code2.js, 
so a plagiarism of 90% if found which is not at acceptable level. Even though it is a programming related assignment, 
the instructors can reject this assignment because line to line code including comment lines are copied in code2.js from code1.js  

In code1.js

In code2.js

In code1.js

In code1.js

In code2.js

In code1.js

In code2.js

In code2.js

In code1.js

In code2.js
